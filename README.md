- The folders are named according to the different sections of the course
- Each section has a server.js which has an express server serving an html page index.html, which contains a javascript file embedded into it. The javascript file corresponds to the particular video. We can change the js file in the html to run the js files of different videos
- index.html is the boilerplate page that is used to check for console output on the browser. 
- Output of the javascript code can also be checked on the terminal by "node <file_name>.js" without the use of html file or the express server
