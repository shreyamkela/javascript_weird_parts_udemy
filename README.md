- The 02_execution_context section in particular, shows another way of running the javascript code and showing the output on the browser console. It has a server.js which has an express server serving an html page index.html. The html page contains the javascript code file embedded into it. The javascript file corresponds to the particular video. We can change the js file in the html to run the js files of different videos. index.html is the boilerplate html page that is used to check for console output of the javascript code on the browser.
